It’s not possible in this demo to build basic oil processing and also not possible to provide blueprints.txt — the tech just isn’t available.

Items/min on one yellow belt
A single yellow belt carries about 900 items/min (15 items/s × 60).
Iron plates/min needed for 120 green circuits/min
Each green circuit = 1 iron plate + 3 copper cables
So for 120 green circuits/min, we need:
120 iron plates/min
Plus the copper cables made from about 40 copper plates/min

Bottleneck and Fix
I found it quite difficult to reach 120 green circuits per minute, but I’ve finally managed to achieve it by smartly scaling all the upstream productions — mainly iron plates, copper cables, and green circuit assemblers.

Simplification
Automating the copper stone and iron stone mining and transporting via train really made things simple.
